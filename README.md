# Enter the Gungeon Base API Mod

### License: MIT

----

This repository houses the "Mod the Gungeon" (ETGMod) modding API for the game "Enter the Gungeon."  

The "base backend" will be installed before anything else in [the ETGMod.Installer](https://github.com/ModTheGungeon/ETGMod.Installer).

It is still in its early phases. Do not expect anything usable for end-users here for quite a while.

For compatibility reasons, it contains its own copy of Mono.Cecil (it's not a submodule).  

# Before contributing

Make sure to read the [Code Style Guide](STYLE.md) and the [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) documents.

# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### How do I make mods?

ETGMod is work in progress software. We do not yet offer a stable API.

### Is there a Mac version?

Worry not, ETGMod is written in the same language as Gungeon and uses the same runtime as Gungeon, Mono.  
It already runs on Windows, Linux and Mac.

### Is there a Linux version?

Read the answer to the question above.

### Console modding?

PS4 modding will never happen. The platform differs a lot from PC and we've never worked with programming for consoles.

### Are the devs okay with this?

The developers of the game actually helped us with some code for ETGMod.  
They often hang out in the Gungeon Discord and are really great people.

### Does this work on pirated copies of the game?

We do not support pirated copies of the game. You're on your own.  
We suggest supporting the awesome devs! Things would probably look a lot different if they weren't as supportive as they are.

### This is too complicated for me. How do I install a mod?

ETGMod is work in progress software. We're working on simple tutorials.  
We'll make sure to have them before we release a stable version.
