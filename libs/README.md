The versions here are versions stripped with the FmbLibStripper tool.

# DON'T PUSH THE ORIGINAL VERSION OF THE STRIPPED LIBS!

Feel free to replace the .dlls **locally** though.

Files that are not stripped as their full functionality is required:

* Ionic.Zip.dll
* Mono.Cecil.dll
* PEG.dll (npeg)
* Newtonsoft.Json.dll
